Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source. Inspired and based on [Una's Personal Goals](https://github.com/una/personal-goals)

Why? I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Write more blog posts
2. Read more books: [currently reading](/books/books-in-progress.md) / [read since October 2016](/books/books-read.md)
3. Increase speed and stamina - Running (and cycling)
4. Always Be Learning - especially JavaScript, CSS, Accessibility
5. Be kind
