# Goals for 2017



## Personal Goals
While I love learning about code I think that the last year I have done less outside of work. I'd like to meet more people (friends, family and new friends), attend more meetups, and spend less time in front of the screen or inside.
- [ ] More time with family and friends
- [ ] attend more meetups

## Professional Goals
I love learning JavaScript and what can be done with it is amazing, I love learning so will carry on with learning about JS including APIs, ES2015+, Node and React. I will use this knowledge to get a job where JS skills are highly valued.

I also love using the Raspberry Pi to do some things e.g. interact with the real world, record data, use data, and so forth. I will continue to experiment with this and learn more about the WordPress REST API to handle and display the data.

- [ ] learn more about APIs, ES2015/ES2016, Node and React
- [ ] Use these skills to do things in the real world

## Fitness Goals
I'd like to get back into running again, to help me regain fitness, chill the hell out, and get away from the screen after work.

- [ ] Reading half-marathon - 19th March to give myself a target 
- [ ] Join running club ([Didcot Runners](http://didcotrunners.org.uk/club-info))
- [ ] Run 3x a week - 2x days out of Mon, Wed, Fri,  plus Tuesdays

## Travelling Goals
This year we had holidays in the UK with a few short breaks to France to see the family there. The world is a big place and more countries need to be visited! 
- [ ] Have more holidays
- [ ] Visit new countries
