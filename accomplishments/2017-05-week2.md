- Continue [Learn Node](https://learnnode.com) course
- Tidy house and life after holiday

First week back at work, now have a Windows 10 laptop and a smaller desk sitting in front of noisy people so have been listening to a lot more music while I work. Weds all other colleagues were out at a off-site day so I had the place to my self. Very productive day.

Have been doing Learn Node project in lunchtime and after work. About half way through it now. Good course but so far not too much learning other than Pug templating and about Schemas and setting up MongoDB. Will hope that there is more interesting stuff the latter half of the course.

The Giro d'Italia is going on at the moment so have been following that closely including watching the latter halves of the stages over the weekend. Super hard stage yesterday up the Blockhaus but before they reached that a Police moto decided to park at the edge of the narrow road. Several Sky and Orica riders including Adam Yates, Thomas, and Llanda affected/crashed thus taking out many of the contenders before the action started. Quintana destroyed those still standing.

Finally I bought some Palomino Blackwing pencils!
