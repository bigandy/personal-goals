### Week in Review:
This week I read and learnt a lot about IndexedDB (IDB), background-sync, and performance. I applied this knowledge and started a few experimental sites. I began turning the react-version of my site towards a more performant version utilising IDB, into a PWA also with mixed success. Lots more to do there!

Out of work the weather has been sometimes warm, and sometimes with some sunshine. On Sunday lunch we took Arthur in the bike trailer and went for a ride. Only 9 miles but hard hard work for me pulling him along. Was super good fun and looking forward to doing it again soon.
