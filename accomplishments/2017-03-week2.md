### Week in Review:
I was ill for much of this week and so didn't have much energy to do much in the evenings. I didn't do Reading Half which I was looking forward to and I need to think of the next running races that I would like to enter.

I experimented with the new CSS Grid technology that has arrived in Chrome and Firefox, implementing it on [my personal jekyll site](https://bigandy.pw) and on in [pens on Codepen](http://codepen.io/collection/nMjLzp/).

I finally started on v6 of my [personal WordPress site](https://big-andy.co.uk), stripping everything back to the bare bones ready to build up from there.

On Saturday there was a lot of sport, I took Arthur to his Rugby tots in the morning and then after visiting the garden center and local bakery we all watched parts of the Six Nations Rugby games. England won the Championship but were beaten by Ireland, France beat Wales after 20 minutes of extra time; Scotland beat Italy. I didn't watch too much of either these two games. Around all of the rugby I did some house chores. I watched the final 25 km of Milan Sanremo. Sagan attacked on the Pogio but was beaten into second in a three-way sprint by Kwiatkowski - very exciting!

Sunday I relaxed and then did more house chores and played with Arthur.
