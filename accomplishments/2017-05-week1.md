12th (?) Pidgeon walking weekend finally we made it to the Lakes. Absolutely stunning scenery, excellent weather (though a bit windy). 

Then we stayed up for the rest of the week with my parents in a Lodge in Windermere where the weather got better (sunny all the time, though still windy up high. 

Drove back via Macc so broke the long journey into two parts. Watched the 3rd stage of the Giro on TV was super knackered on Sun after long journey home.
