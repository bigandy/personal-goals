### Week in Review:
A long week. Weds watched victorious rugby final when London Irish promoted back to Premiership. Thurs took train to Chateauroux via London, Paris and Orleans. Super hot in France but very relaxed. Turned phone off most of the time and chilled, went to a birthday party and swam in outdoor pool. Travelling with a toddler and cramped Eurostar (2 seats for 3 of us not enough) super tiring. Dumoulin won the Giro!
