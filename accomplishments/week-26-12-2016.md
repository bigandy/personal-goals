Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source. Inspired and based on [Una's Personal Goals](https://github.com/una/personal-goals). I am keeping them here because: accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

2. Read more books: [currently reading](/books/books-in-progress.md) / [read since October 2016](/books/books-read.md)
