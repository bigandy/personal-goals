- WordPress / Redis / Node-WPAPI Project
- Watch Champions League Final
- Look after Arthur Sun AM

### Week in Review:
On Monday we had a supremely long journey back from France not helped by the long wait at Gare du Nord, resulting in a knackering week. The weekend was super chilled and I looked after Arthur, watched some cycling and the champions league final, AND I finally figured out how to connect WordPress and Node via Redis.
