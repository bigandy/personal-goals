### Week in Review:
An excellent weekend was had - mostly in the garden painting the fence and gate and playing with Arthur - but also rugby tots, Little Professors and going to the cafe by the river. Weather was superb. Clocks went forward on Sun so lots more light in the envenings. Rest of week spent getting over cold.
