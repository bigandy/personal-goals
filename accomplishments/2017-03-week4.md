### Week in Review:
Marion's parents are visiting this week so we did lots of fun outdoors things over the weekend including going to the lambing at the Earth Trust and Beale Park.

The final three days of last week I was at Render Conf, including a Web Perf Workshop. Loads and loads of information to process.

Weather has been superb.
